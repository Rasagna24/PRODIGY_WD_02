# Stopwatch Web Application

## Overview

Hi Everyone! I'm Rasagna, and I'm excited to present my completion of Task 2. This web application provides a fully functional stopwatch with features such as start, pause, reset, and lap recording. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly timer.

## Features

- **Start:** Initiates the stopwatch from zero.
- **Pause/Play:** Pauses or resumes the stopwatch timer.
- **Reset:** Stops the timer and resets it to zero.
- **Lap:** Records current elapsed time as a lap time.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and layout of the stopwatch interface.
- **CSS:** Styling for a modern, dark neon theme, including a moving outer rectangle box highlighted with neon colors.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for time tracking, formatting, and button interactions.

## Compatibility and Deployment

- This stopwatch application does not rely on external images or assets.
- It features a moving outer rectangle box highlighted with neon colors to enhance the user experience.
- It can be easily run and tested in development environments like CodePen or VS Code directly.
